# Prevent GitInfo.swift Merge Conflicts

## Context
GitInfo.swift is auto-generated by a pre-build script (in `project.yml`) on every Xcode build. It writes the current git branch and commit hash. Because it's tracked in git, every branch merge produces a trivial conflict on the `branch` line. This is wasted effort to resolve manually.

## Approach: Stop tracking the generated file

Since GitInfo.swift is regenerated on every build, there's no reason to track it. This is the standard practice for generated files.

**Option A — `.gitignore` (Recommended)**
- Add the file to `.gitignore`
- Remove it from git tracking with `git rm --cached`
- Conflicts become impossible; file is always fresh from the build script

**Option B — `.gitattributes` merge driver**
- Create `.gitattributes` with a custom `merge=ours` driver
- Keeps the file tracked but auto-resolves conflicts by keeping the current branch's version
- More complex, requires per-repo git config setup

Option A is simpler with no downsides since the file is rebuilt every time.

## Changes

### 1. Add to `.gitignore`
**File:** `.gitignore`
- Add `final\ final/App/GitInfo.swift` to the "Build outputs" section

### 2. Remove from git tracking
```bash
git rm --cached "final final/App/GitInfo.swift"
```
This stops tracking the file without deleting it from disk.

## Verification
1. Run `git status` — GitInfo.swift should show as deleted from index (not as untracked, since .gitignore covers it)
2. Build the project — GitInfo.swift is regenerated by the pre-build script
3. Create a test branch, build, switch back to main, build, merge — no conflict

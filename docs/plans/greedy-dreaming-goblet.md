# Merge cm-scroll-bug-2nd-try into main

## Context
Merging 2 remaining fix commits (`183142b`, `6f40204`) from `cm-scroll-bug-2nd-try` into `main`. An earlier commit from this branch was already merged. The merge is in progress but blocked by a conflict in `GitInfo.swift`.

## Conflict Analysis
- **Only conflict:** `final final/App/GitInfo.swift` — auto-generated file recording branch name and commit hash
- **Resolution:** Accept HEAD (main) version. This file is regenerated by the pre-build script on every build, so the content doesn't matter.
- **Clean merges:** `docs/findings/cm-scroll-height-contamination.md` and `web/codemirror/src/line-height-fix.ts` merged without conflict.

## Steps
1. Resolve `GitInfo.swift` by writing the correct main-branch content (removing conflict markers)
2. `git add "final final/App/GitInfo.swift"` to mark resolved
3. `git commit` to complete the merge (no custom message needed — git auto-generates merge commit message)

## Verification
- `git log --oneline -5` should show the merge commit with both feature branch commits accessible
- `git status` should be clean
- `git branch -d cm-scroll-bug-2nd-try` can be run after to clean up (optional, will confirm with user)
